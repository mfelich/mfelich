💡 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student from Bosnia and Herzegovina with a passion for understanding how and why things work — a curiosity I bring straight into backend development. I enjoy building clean and scalable systems with secure authentication.

Even in everyday life, I’m fascinated by understanding how and why things work, which fuels my passion for developing backend systems. My goal is to create reliable, maintainable, and efficient backend solutions that scale well and support real-world business needs.
