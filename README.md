## 💡 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student from Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a deep passion for backend development using Java and Spring Boot. I thrive on challenges and enjoy building real-world applications that solve actual problems.

I’m especially interested in system architecture, clean code, and backend logic. I believe learning never stops, and I'm constantly exploring how to push my skills further — one line of code at a time.
